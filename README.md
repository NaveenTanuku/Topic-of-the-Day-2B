## App Focus:
The main goal of our progressive app is to assist the bearcats to get the information about the updates of different topics that are happening in the university and to check if they reached out to them.

## Deployment

• We made it easier for the application to be **deployed** automatically When you make any **changes** to the repository, the **build** will start **deploying** to Heroku **automatically**. </br>
• If you make any changes to a repo and they **aren't** automatically deployed, try **manually** deploying them to see if they show up in the app.
